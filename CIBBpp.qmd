## Motivating example: a clinical question on Milan 1 {.test}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
How the different treatment approaches compares in preventing distant metastases?
:::
:::

::: fragment
In **Milan 1 (Mi1)** (30 years of follow-up; 193 DMs): **radical mastectomy** (**MAST**; 349 patients) vs **breast conserving surgery with radiotherapy** (**BCS+RT**; 351 patients)
:::

::: fragment
The **effect** of treatment (T) on the risk of distant metastases **may differ depending on the status of axillary involvement (N)** (**modification effect**) and that it should not be constant through the overall follow-up time (**time-dependent effects**)
:::

::: {.fragment .p}
The clinical query was formulated and already discussed at ESMO breast cancer conference in Berlin\[1\]
:::

## The analysis of time-to-event data in the presence of competing risks {.test}

## The relationship between SDH and CCI {.test}

::: fragment
Crude cumulative incidence (CCI) is the quantity of theoretical interest and practical application

$$
CCI_{k} = P(T\le t| D = k)
$$ {#eq-1}
:::

::: fragment
The sub-distribution hazard (SDH) dispalys the instantaneous rate of occurrence of an event (i.e., the intensity of the process) over time
:::

::: fragment
$$
\lambda^{sd}_{k}(t)= \lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t, D = k | T \ge t \cup(T < t \cap K \neq k ))}{\Delta t}
$$ {#eq-2}
:::

::: fragment
And it is directly linked to CCI: $$CCI_{k}(t)= 1-e^{-\int_{0}^{u}\lambda^{sd}_{k}(u)du}$$ {#eq-3}
:::

## Two alternative way to estimate CCI {.test}

::: incremental
-   Highly flexible SM that smooths the shape of the underlying sub-distribution hazard function to then obtain CCI estimates via numeric integration

-   Pseudovalues calculated on CCI

-   B-splines to smooth the baseline of the SDH function or the CCI function
:::

## Modeling SDH: The discrete-time SDH model {.test}

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .p}
-   Time is divided in intervals of 3 months
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .p}
-   Depending on the status of the subjects in each time intervals some weights are computed
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .p}
-   For subjects that experience the event of interest or that experience a censoring event first the weights are definted as: $$w_{i,t} := I(t \le \tilde{T}_{i})$$ {#eq-6} $$ w_{i, 1},w_{i, 2}...w_{i, \tilde{T_{i}}}, w_{i, ( \tilde{T_{i}}+1)},...w_{i, (k-1)} = (1,1,...1,0,...0)  $$ {#eq-7}
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .p}
-   For subjects that experience another event only, or experience it before that of interest, weights are definted as: $$w_{i,t} := \frac{\hat{G}(t-1)}{\hat{G}(\tilde{T}_{i}-1)},\:\tilde{T}_{i}<t\le k-1 $$ {#eq-8}
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .p}
Here $\hat{G}$ is an estimate of the censoring survival function $G(t) = P(C_{i}>t)$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .p}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red .p}
-   The estimation of the SDH is performed with a weighted ML estimation scheme for binary regression with a log link
:::
:::

## Modeling CCI: The transformation model on pseudovalues computed on CCI {.test}

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .p}
-   Pseudo-observations are computed on crude cumulative incidence at 10 different time-points of the FU for each subject
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .p}
$$
\hat{\theta_{i}} = n \cdot \hat{\theta} - (n -1) \cdot \hat{\theta}^{i-1}
$$ {#eq-4} Here, $\theta = E(f(X)) = CCI_{k}$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .p}
-   Pseudo-observation considered as response in a generalized linear model framework, with a *gaussian* family of the error distribution and a *log* function to link the linear predictor to the response
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .p}
-   The *within-subject* correlation **should be** accounted with generalised estimating equations (GEE) to give correct estimates of the standard errors (❗linear predictors among GLM and GEE do not change, only the standard errors)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .p}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
-   The exponentiated coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals give **directly** estimates of **relative risk** and **its 95% confidence intervals**
:::
:::

## Question {.test}

::: incremental
-   Discrete model on SDH describes the relative effect of covariates on the **subdistribution hazard function which is directly related to CCI**.

-   The covariates in this model **interpreted as having an effect on CCI**.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red .l}
Does complex effects found in modeling SDH translate directly in CCI?
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .highlight-blue .l}
**Comparison between the robustness of the effects found in modeling SDH or CCI**
:::
:::

## Conclusions {.test}

::: incremental
-   For the same function used to link (log) the response variable with the linear predictor in GLM model, the agreement between final model structures selected by AIC of the sub-distribution hazard and of the crude cumulative incidence is low (weighted Cohen's Kappa coefficient = 0.23).

-   Finally, in clinical settings in which proportional sub-distribution hazard are difficult to assume and complex effect of the covariates are expected, **if the interest is in exploring complex effect on CCI of an event of interest**, researcher should consider to utilize a modeling framework that **directly model on CCI**, although the point estimates of the CCI is more accurate when obtained by predicted SDH.

-   To such end, transformation model on pseudo-observations computed on CCI are suggested when the number of event is high relative to the sample size given the plausibility of the estimates (always check!)

-   In an exploratory aim, perturbation of the data is suggested to assess the robustness of the complex effects biologically and clinically feasible.
:::

## Further developments {.test}

::: incremental
-   Apply constraints to estimate a monotonic CCI function comprised between 0 and 1
-   Assess the behavior of less flexible spline bases (such as the truncated power bases of the restricted cubic regression splines) when estimating CCI
-   Apply a penalization for the smoothing of the SDH function exploiting penalized splines or GAM smoothing splines.
-   Considering a more sofisticated bootstrap plan
